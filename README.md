# Noemdek Assessment Task B

This repository contains Task B for the noemdek assessment. It includes the implementation of a server-side application.

## Database choice explanation

Due to the seemingly sparse nature of data in this particular task, a NoSQL DBMS like MongoDB suffices excellently. It supports speed of model creation and performing CRUD operations.

3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage
